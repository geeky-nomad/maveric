It might sound shocking, but worldwide, 9 million people die each year solely due to air pollution.
This is partly because indoor air is considered much more polluted, despite us spending 90% of our time indoors.

But don't worry, at Bioteos, we believe that Nature holds the solution to purifying indoor air: microalgae! These microscopic algae have the ability to use certain atmospheric pollutants to thrive.

Drawing inspiration from nature, we have patented a biological filter that improves air quality by treating not only atmospheric pollutants but also viruses and bacteria.

We have integrated this technology into a range of two products:

OXYLON Urban, urban furniture designed for metro stations, capable of treating 700 m3/h of air. It can purify the air of a metro station covering more than 400m2.

OXYLON S, office furniture suitable for smaller spaces, coworking spaces, or cafeterias.

THE PROBLEM
 Some of the problems with traditional farming are:
 ➢ It produces less food compared to modern farming methods, which can lead to food insecurity and poverty.
 ➢ It takes more time and labour to complete certain tasks, such as ploughing, weeding, harvesting, etc.
 ➢ It sometimes causes soil erosion, nutrient depletion, and chemical pollution, which can degrade the quality and fertility of the land. 
➢ It involves deforestation and slash-and-burn activities, which can destroy natural habitats, biodiversity, and carbon sinks. 
➢ It depends heavily on the season and climate, which can make it vulnerable to droughts, floods, pests, and diseases. These problems can have negative impacts on the environment, the economy, and the society.

In factories, tons of sensors powered by cables frequently break down, particularly those installed on robots and moving parts. This causes the manufacturing line to stop. We’re addressing this issue with our wireless power technology.

2. BM
Building management faces problems with comfort of people in an office and energy savings. As the sensor is only installed in the conventional AC, there is a temperature gap between the ceiling and where people work.

However, Si has hardly been used because it has a large irreversible capacity, and a large volume change due to a charge/discharge reaction. ORLIB has developed the pressurized pre-doping technology to reduce irreversible capacity and the volume changes. Pre-doped Si, pSi, can be combined with various LIB cathodes to increase the energy by more than 1.5 times, making it possible to create high-energy batteries with low cost and rare metal-free LFP comparable to high energy LMNC.
